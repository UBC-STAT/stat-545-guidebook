## Part 1: Running Rscripts from the terminal/command prompt (15 mins)

This section has been adapted from Tiffany Timbers' DSCI 522 lectures found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_dsci-workflows/blob/master/lectures/02_lecture-intro-to-scripts.ipynb).

### "REPL" vs. non-interactive scripts
So far in STAT 545 and 547M, we have only been working on Rmd files and interactively working with code.
We run and re-run specific code chunks, add bits of code, and re-run it to get updated results. 
Of course, this works - but is it reproducible ?
Can you trust that in a week, or a month, or a year from now that you will be able to reproduce the exact steps needed to get the same answer?
Usually not. 
The above style of working actually has a name: REPL, or Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.
Despite the fact that it's usually not easily reproducible, it is actually VERY useful!
It's good for:
  - solving smaller problems in projects limited in scope
  - explore and play around with unfamiliar and unknown datasets
  - developing code that will eventually make its way into a script or turned into a function
  - developing code that you will only use once
It is rare that data scientists would go directly towards creating scripts and functions without first developing them in a REPL environment. 

At this point, you may be wondering what scripts *are* and *why* we should write them?.
Well, an R script is just a text file that contains R code that is run in a sequence, usually with no or minimal intervention from the user. 
Scripts are generally run from the Terminal, but can also be run from IDEs (interactive developer environment; RStudio is an IDE) and even the Rconsole using `source(script_name.R)`.

As for why:
  - Scripts are generally more time efficient (especially for long term usage)
  - You can combine multiple scripts to create an analysis pipeline (next week!)
  - Scripts can be reused and adapted for different purposes; additional functionality can be added to scripts without removing the ability of it working for previous analyses
  - Are an important component of reproducible workflows

Alright now that we know how REPL, or interactive scripts differ from non-interactive scripts, let's move on and actually create R scripts from interactive R code.

### Converting interactive R code to a scripted, non-interactive version

Let's just do a quick sanity check to make sure our script can run. 
- Step 1: In the cm104 directory, create a new blank .R script and save it as `first_script.R`
  - In RStudio, File > New File > R Script.
- Step 2: Write the following R code inside `first_script.R`:
  - `print('Hello World')`
- Step 3: Run the Rscript by opening a new Terminal, navigating to the directory where `first_script.R` exists and then type:
  - `Rscript first_script.R`
  - "Hello World" should be printed to the Terminal and the R script will finish.
- Step 4: Navigate to one directory above the current directory with `cd ..`
  - Now try running `first_script.R` - does it work?
  - How would you modify `Rscript first_script.R` to make it work (without going into the `cm104` directory)?

```
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
Rscript cm104/first_script.R
```
  
Okay, let's do something slightly more interesting: a quick demo using an interactive script that we're going to write together.

#### Your Task 1: 
  - Start with the `mtcars` dataset
  - Use `dplyr::mutate` to create a new column for the fuel efficiency in L/100km rather than mpg
  - Create a plot of Horse power vs. fuel efficiency

```{r interactive_mtcars_demo}
head(mtcars)
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
mtcars %>%
  mutate(lkm = 235.2145 / mpg) %>% # imperial = 282.48, #US = 235.21
  ggplot(aes(x = lkm, y = hp)) + geom_point() + 
  theme_bw(16) + # Set font size like this 
  labs(x = 'Fuel efficiency (L/100 km)',
       y = 'Horse power (hp)',
       title = "Fuel efficiency by horse power")
```

#### Your Task 2: 
  - Use the code above as a starting point
  - Copy the code above and paste it into `first_script.R`
  - Move the mutate command into a separate function
  - Your function should take in a string argument with two options: "USA" and "Imperial" (set a reasonable default)
  - Try running the script. Did it work? Was there a plot produced?
  - If yes, great! If not, what did you have to change to get it to work? 
  - Can you explain why?
  
```{r working_mtcars_demo}
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

fuel_conversion <- function (df, gallon_type = 'USA') { 
  
  if (gallon_type == 'USA') {
    conv = 235.2145
  } else {
    conv = 282.48
  }
  df %>% mutate(lkm = conv / mpg)
    
  }

mtcars %>%
  fuel_conversion(gallon_type = 'Imperial') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lkm, y = hp)) + geom_point() +
  theme_bw(16) + # Set font size like this
  labs(x = 'Fuel efficiency (L/100 km)',
       y = 'Horse power (hp)',
       title = "Fuel efficiency by horse power") +
  ggsave('test_plot.png', width = 8, height = 5)
```

Great! 
Looks like things are working!
Let's organize our script in a slightly more useful way.

### Structure of scripts

It is very good practice to organize the code in your script into a main function and other functions. 
This practice keeps your code readable and organized, this has some additional benefits we will discuss later.
Here is a suggested script organization:

```
# documentation for how to use scripts and comments

# Load libraries and packages

# parse/define command line arguments here

# define main function
main <- function(){
    # code for "guts" of script goes here
}

# Code for other functions & tests

# call main function
main()
```

For documentation, it is suggested to use `roxygen2` [style](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html).
Here is an example of this style:

```
#' Add together two numbers
#'
#' @param x A number
#' @param y A number
#' @return The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```
#### Your Task 3: Create a script and conform to the suggested structure
Let's edit our script from the previous section (`first_script.R`) to conform to this structure. 
When you're done, paste in the contents of your script here:

```
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE (contents of first_script.R)

# author: Firas Moosvi
# date: 2020-03-05

"This script adds a new column to the `mtcars` dataset converting fuel efficiency from miles per gallon to Litres per 100km. This script takes the gallon_type as the variable argument.

Usage: first_script.R <gallon_type>
"

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(glue)

main <- function(gallon_type){
  
  mtcars %>%
    fuel_conversion(gallon_type = 'Imperial') %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = lkm, y = hp)) + geom_point() +
    theme_bw(16) + # Set font size like this
    labs(x = 'Fuel efficiency (L/100 km)',
         y = 'Horse power (hp)',
         title = "Fuel efficiency by horse power") +
    ggsave('test_plot.png', width = 8, height = 5)
    
    print(glue("The gallon_type is ", gallon_type))
}

#' calculate fuel efficiency in L/100km
#' 
#' @param df is an input of the mtcars dataframe
#' @param gallon_type is a string either `USA` or `Imperial`
#' @examples
#' fuel_conversion('USA')
fuel_conversion <- function (df, gallon_type = 'USA') { 
  
  if (gallon_type == 'USA') {
    conv = 235.2145
  } else {
    conv = 282.48
  }
  df %>% mutate(lkm = conv / mpg)
  }
  
### tests

main()
```
### Summary and key points of scripts

- ## YOUR NOTES HERE
- 
- 

What if we wanted to specify the arguments of assignment to the imperial definition of gallon rather than the US one?
For that, we need to look at command line arguments!

## Part 2: Command-line arguments and docopt (30 mins)

This section has been adapted from Tiffany Timbers' DSCI 522 lectures found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_dsci-workflows/blob/master/lectures/02_lecture-intro-to-scripts.ipynb). 

### Introduction to docopt

We will be following the documentation for docopt [here](https://docopt.org).

Key points:

- Arguments for your script can be specified by "position" or as "options"
- Options is almost always better as it allows your code and scripts to be more readable
- To allow your non-mandatory arguments use `[ ]`
- Use parantheses `( )` for required arguments
- Complex arguments can be set up using the `|` (pipe) indicating "OR" as well as `...` to indicate repeating elements

### Adding command line arguments in R

Let's make our script more flexible, and specify when we call the script, whether the `gallon_type` is `US` or `Imperial` variable.

To do this, we use the `docopt` R package. This will allow us to collect the text we enter at the command line when we call the script, and make it available to us when we run the script. 

When we run `docopt` it takes the text we entered at the command line and gives it to us as a named list of the text provided after the script name.
The names of the items in the list come from the documentation.
Whitespace at the command line is what is used to parse the text into separate items in the vector.

```
# author: Firas Moosvi

library(docopt)  # THIS IS NEW
library(glue)

# THIS IS NEW
opt <- docopt(doc) # This is where the "Usage" gets converted into code that allows you to use commandline arguments

main <- function(gallon_type){

         y = 'Horse power (hp)',

    ggsave('test_plot.png', width = 8, height = 5)
    
    print(glue("The gallon_type is ", gallon_type))
}

#' calculate fuel efficiency in L/100km
#' 
#' @param df is an input of the mtcars dataframe
#' @param gallon_type is a string either `USA` or `Imperial`
#' @examples
#' fuel_conversion('USA')
fuel_conversion <- function (df, gallon_type = 'USA') { 
  
  if (gallon_type == 'USA') {
    conv = 235.2145
  } else {
    conv = 282.48
  }
  df %>% mutate(lkm = conv / mpg)
  }
  
### tests

main(opt$gallon_type)  # THIS IS NEW
```

To run this script from the commandline, we would open a Terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:

```
Rscript first_script.R 'Imperial'
```

And that's it! 
You've just written your first R script with command line options! 
This is a big deal!
The power you now wield is enormous!

### Positional vs. option arguments

In the examples above, we used `docopt` to specify a positional argument (gallon_type).
This means that the order matters! 
If we added another argument the same way we added `gallon_type`, the order that we specify the arguments will matter.
Our script will likely throw an error because it will try to perform the wrong operations using the wrong arguments. 

Another downside to positional arguments, is that without good documentation, they can be less readable. 
And certainly the call to the script to is less readable. 
We should instead give the arguments names using `--ARGUMENT_NAME` syntax. 
We call these "options". 
Below is the same script but specified using options rather than to positional arguments:

```
# author: Firas Moosvi
# date: 2020-03-05

"This script adds a new column to the `mtcars` dataset converting fuel efficiency from miles per gallon to Litres per 100km. This script takes the gallon_type as the variable argument.

Usage: first_script.R --gallon_type=<gallon_type>
" -> doc

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(docopt)
library(glue)

opt <- docopt(doc) # This is where the "Usage" gets converted into code that allows you to use commandline arguments

main <- function(gallon_type){
  
  mtcars %>%
    fuel_conversion(gallon_type = 'Imperial') %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = lkm, y = hp)) + geom_point() +
    theme_bw(16) + # Set font size like this
    labs(x = 'Fuel efficiency (L/100 km)',
         y = 'Horse power (hp)',
         title = "Fuel efficiency by horse power") +
    ggsave('test_plot.png', width = 8, height = 5)
    
    print(glue("The gallon_type is ", gallon_type))
}

#' calculate fuel efficiency in L/100km
#' 
#' @param df is an input of the mtcars dataframe
#' @param gallon_type is a string either `USA` or `Imperial`
#' @examples
#' fuel_conversion('USA')
fuel_conversion <- function (df, gallon_type = 'USA') { 
  
  if (gallon_type == 'USA') {
    conv = 235.2145
  } else {
    conv = 282.48
  }
  df %>% mutate(lkm = conv / mpg)
  }
  
### tests

main(opt$gallon_type)
```

Now we would call the script like this:

```
Rscript first_script.R --gallon_type='Imperial'
```

Now that the arguments have names, if we had multiple arguments, the order doesn't matter anymore!

#### Your Task 4: Update the script above and add a second required argument and print it out using glue.

```
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE (contents of first_script.R)
```

### Summary and key points of options

- `docopt` is a REALLY useful R package that allows us to easily add arguments and options to our scripts
- You should always have named arguments, or options for scripts; makes your scripts much more readable
- Arguments for your script can be specified by "position" or as "options"
- Options is almost always better as it allows your code and scripts to be more readable
- To allow your non-mandatory arguments use `[ ]`
- Use parantheses `( )` for required arguments
- Complex arguments can be set up using the `|` (pipe) indicating "OR" as well as `...` to indicate repeating elements


## Part 3: Writing tests for your functions

This section has been adapted from 

This section is adapted from Chapter 8 of the [tidynomicon textbook by Greg Wilson](https://gvwilson.github.io/tidynomicon/).

### Testing and Error Handling

Novices write code and pray that it works.
Experienced programmers know that prayer alone is not enough, and take steps to protect what little sanity they have left.
This chapter looks at the tools R gives us for doing this.

### How does R handle errors?

We say that the operation [signals](glossary.html#signal-condition) a [condition](glossary.html#condition) that some other piece of code then [handles](glossary.html#handle-condition).
These things are all simpler to do using the rlang library, so we begin by loading that:

In order of increasing severity, the three built-in kinds of conditions are [messages](glossary.html#message), [warnings](glossary.html#warning), and [errors](glossary.html#error).
(There are also interrupts, which are generated by the user pressing Ctrl-C to stop an operation, but we will ignore those for the sake of brevity.)
We can signal conditions of these kinds using the functions `message`, `warning`, and `stop`, each of which takes an error message as a parameter:

```{r message-warning-error, error=TRUE}
message("This is a message.")
warning("This is a warning.\n")
stop("This is an error.")
```

Note that we have to supply our own line ending for warnings but not for the other two cases.
Note also that there are very few situations in which a warning is appropriate: if something has truly gone wrong then we should stop, but otherwise we should not distract users from more pressing concerns.

The bluntest of instruments for handling errors is to ignore them. 
If a statement is wrapped in the function `try` then errors that occur in it are still reported, but execution continues.
Compare this:

```{r attempt-without-try, error=TRUE}
attemptWithoutTry <- function(left, right){
  temp <- left + right
  "result" # returned
}
result <- attemptWithoutTry(1, "two")
cat("result is", result)
```

with this:

```{r attempt-using-try}
attemptUsingTry <- function(left, right){
  temp <- try(left + right)
  "value returned" # returned
}
result <- attemptUsingTry(1, "two")
cat("result is", result)
```

We can suppress error messages from `try` by setting `silent` to `TRUE`:

```{r attempt-quietly}
attemptUsingTryQuietly <- function(left, right){
  temp <- try(left + right, silent = TRUE)
  "result" # returned
}
result <- attemptUsingTryQuietly(1, "two")
cat("result is", result)
```

Do NOT do this, lest you one day find yourself lost in a silent hellscape.

Should you more sensibly wish to handle conditions rather than ignore them, you may invoke `tryCatch`.

We begin by raising an error explicitly:

```{r r-try-catch}
tryCatch(
  stop("our message"),
  error = function(cnd) print(glue("error object is {cnd}"))
)
```
We can now run a function that would otherwise blow up:

```{r r-try-catch-triggered}
tryCatch(
  attemptWithoutTry(1, "two"),
  error = function(cnd) print(glue("error object is {cnd}"))
)
```

### What should I know about testing in general?

In keeping with common programming practice, we have left testing until the last possible moment.
The standard testing library for R is [testthat][testthat] and this is how tests are handled in R:

1.  Each test consists of a single function that tests a single property or behavior of the system.
2.  Tests are collected into files with prescribed names that can be found by a test runner (code that is automatically run once after each unit test).
3.  Shared setup (code that is automatically run once before each unit test) and teardown (Code that is automatically run once after each unit test) steps are put in functions of their own.

For now in STAT547, we will use the `testthat` library to test our functions in-line our Rscripts, though it is much better practice to set up your tests in a `tests` directory and have them run automatically.

Let's load it and write our first test:

```{r introduce-testthat}
test_that("Zero equals itself", {expect_equal(0, 0)})
```

As is conventional with unit testing libraries, no news is good news: if a test passes, it doesn't produce output because it doesn't need our attention.
Let's try something that ought to fail:

```{r error = TRUE}
test_that("Zero equals one", {expect_equal(0, 1)})
```

If you run this, you should see something like:

```
Error: Test failed: 'Zero equals one' * 0 not equal to 1. 1/1 mismatches [1] 0 - 1 == -1
```

Good: we can draw some comfort from the fact that Those Beyond have not yet changed the fundamental rules of arithmetic.
But what are the curly braces around `expect_equal` for? The answer is that they create a code block for `test_that` to run.
We can run `expect_equal` on its own:

```{r expect-equal-alone, error=TRUE}
expect_equal(0, 1)
```

but that doesn't produce a summary of how many tests passed or failed.
Passing a block of code to `test_that` also allows us to check several things in one test:

```{r pass-code-block, error=TRUE}
test_that("Testing two things", {
  expect_equal(0, 0)
  expect_equal(0, 1)
})
```

A block of code is *not* the same thing as an anonymous function, which is why running this block of code does nothing — the "test" defines a function
but doesn't actually call it:

```{r anonymous-function}
test_that("Using an anonymous function", function() {
  print("In our anonymous function")
  expect_equal(0, 1)
})
```

### How should I organize my tests?

Running blocks of tests by hand is a bad practice.
Instead, we should put related tests in files and then put those files in a directory called `tests/testthat`.
We can then run some or all of those tests with a single command.

To start, create in your `cm104` folder, create this file: `./tests/testthat/test_example.R`:

```
library(testthat)
context("Demonstrating the testing library")

test_that("Testing a number with itself", {
  expect_equal(0, 0)
  expect_equal(-1, -1)
  expect_equal(Inf, Inf)
})

test_that("Testing different numbers", {
  expect_equal(0, 1)
})

test_that("Testing with a tolerance", {
  expect_equal(0, 0.01, tolerance = 0.05, scale = 1)
  expect_equal(0, 0.01, tolerance = 0.005, scale = 1)
})
```

The first line loads the testthat package, which gives us our tools.
The call to `context` on the second line gives this set of tests a name for reporting purposes.
After that, we add as many calls to `test_that` as we want, each with a name and a block of code.
We can now run this file from within RStudio:

```
test_dir("tests/testthat")
```

The output should be: 

```

Care is needed when interpreting these results.
There are four `test_that` calls, but eight actual checks, and the number of successes and failures is counted by recording the latter, not the former.

What then is the purpose of `test_that`?
Why not just use `expect_equal` and its kin, such as `expect_true`, `expect_false`, `expect_length`, and so on?
The answer is that it allows us to do one operation and then check several things afterward.

Our tests still aren't checking anything statistical, but without trustworthy data,
our statistics will be meaningless.
Tests like these allow our future selves to focus on making new mistakes instead of repeating old ones.

### What type of tests can I do with `testthat` ?

[This page](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/index.html) has a thorough list of "expectations".
Some useful functions are:

- test_dir(), test_package(), test_check(), is_testing(), testing_package(): Expectation: is returned value less or greater than specified value?
- expect_equal(), expect_equivalent(), expect_identical(), expect_reference(): Expectation: is the object equal to a value?
- expect_length(): Expectation: does a vector have the specified length?
... etc

### More practice with `test_that`

The [next two sub-sections](http://tidynomicon.tech/testerror.html#how-should-i-organize-my-tests) of the tidynomicon chapter on testing are likely beyond the scope of STAT547, but I highly encourage you to go through on your own time when you're about to embark on a project for your research!

### Summary and key points of testing

- The three built-in levels of conditions are messages, warnings, and errors.
- Programs/scripts can signal these themselves using the functions `message`, `warning`, and `stop`.
- Operations can be placed in a call to the function tryCatch to handle errors.
- Use `testthat` to write unit tests for R.
- Put tests in files called test_group.R and call them test_something.
- Write tests for data transformation steps (if you can) as well as library functions.
